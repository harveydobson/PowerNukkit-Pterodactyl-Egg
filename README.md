# PowerNukkit-Pterodactyl-Egg
## Forked by @harveydobson to provide support for PHP 8
Kept getting the following error, I hope for this fork to fix it. 
```
  container@pterodactyl~ ./bin/php7/bin/php ./PocketMine-MP.phar --no-wizard --disable-ansi
  env: ‘./bin/php7/bin/php’: No such file or directory
```
This repository hosts the source code of the pterodactyl eggs and docker images for pterodactyl to automate the PowerNukkit setup and updates without effort from the host or server owner.
